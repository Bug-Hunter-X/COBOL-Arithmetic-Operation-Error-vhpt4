This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon COBOL error related to arithmetic operations on fields with different data types. The `bug.cob` file shows the problematic code, which can lead to exceptions or unexpected results. The `bugSolution.cob` file demonstrates a solution that uses explicit type casting or data type conversion to fix the issue.
